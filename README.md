# Video games and memory

Do people who play video games score better than those who do not on tests of cognitive function?

Is there a positive correlation between the amount of time spent playing video games and memory function?

What particular genre has the highest impact?

The goal of this project was to ascertain whether video games benefit memory function. Using public data, I found there to be positive correlations with all memory performance metrics and playing video games. This was particularly prominent with n-back task scores. 

The n-back task is a continuous performance task that is commonly used as an assessment in psychology and cognitive neuroscience to measure a part of working memory and working memory capacity. 

No particular genre had an outsize correlation with the memory test outcomes. 

This leads me to conclude that, in general, playing video games is beneficial to brain operation.
