# Video games and memory

## Raison d'etre

* **Do people who play video games score better than those who do not on tests of cognitive function?**

* **Is there a positive correlation between the amount of time spent playing video games and memory function?**

* **Does any particular variant of game have a greater impact than others?**

The goal of this project was to ascertain whether video games benefit memory function. Using public data, I found there to be positive correlations with all memory performance metrics and playing video games. This was particularly prominent with n-back task scores.

The n-back task is a continuous performance task that is commonly used as an assessment in psychology and cognitive neuroscience to measure a part of working memory and working memory capacity.

The spatial working memory score demonstrates a clear correlation as well. 

According to the data gathered, no particular genre of game had an outsize correlation with the test outcomes. 

I confirmed the statistical significance of what we see on the charts via t-testing. This leads me to conclude that, in general, playing video games is beneficial to brain operation.
